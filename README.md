## Overview

This repository offers a self-guided, project-based approach to learning serverless architecture using AWS and the Serverless Framework. By engaging with a series of mini-projects, you will gain practical experience in building, deploying, and optimizing serverless applications.

## Learning Approach

The projects in this repository guide you through a journey from the basic concepts of serverless architecture to the development of complex, real-world serverless applications. This self-paced learning approach is designed to build foundational knowledge and gradually introduce advanced topics, emphasizing hands-on implementation and real-world scenarios.
